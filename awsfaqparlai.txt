text: can choose a destination depending on your use case. If you have time sensitive use cases and require access log data quickly within a few seconds, then choose the real-time logs. If you need your real-time log pipeline to be cheaper, you can choose to filter the log data by enabling logs only for specific cache behaviors, or choosing a lower sampling rate. The real-time log pipeline is built for quick data delivery. Therefore, log records may be dropped if there are data delays. On the other hand, if you need a low cost log processing solution with no requirement for real-time data then the current standard log option is ideal for you. The standard logs in S3 are built for completeness and the logs are typically available in a few mins. These logs can be enabled for the entire distribution and not for specific cache behaviors. Therefore, if you require logs for adhoc investigation, audit, and analysis, you can choose to only enable the standard logs in S3. You could choose to use a combination of both the logs. Use a filtered list of real-time logs for operational visibility and then use the standard logs for audit.   Q: What are the different log destination options available? CloudFront standard logs are delivered to your S3 bucket. You can also use the integration build by third party solutions such as DataDog and Sumologic to create dashboards from these logs.  The real-time logs are delivered to your Kinesis Data Stream. From Kinesis Data Streams, the logs can be published to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose supports easy data delivery to Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and service providers like Datadog, New Relic, and Splunk.
